# RobloxPCInterface

A helpful tool which lets you interact and execute scripts from your local filesystem in roblox. Especially useful when using an android emulator.

Basically, download serve.py and put it in a folder. Install flask with 'pip install flask'. Then run 'loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/GroceyLot/RobloxPCInterface/raw/Things/interface.lua"))()' in game to open the ui. In the console of the python it will say:

 * Running on all addresses (0.0.0.0)
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:4654
 * Running on http://192.168.1.196:4654
